# Embedded Programming and STM32F4 Tutorial

This tutorial covers embedded software development using GNU tools. It should provide a detailed introduction
into the whole process of development from scratch including toolchain, development techniques, debugging, testing
and simulation. The discovery board with an STM32F407VG microcontroller from STM is the target hardware. This repository
contains all the examples that are fully explained on the [Actuated Robots](http://www.actuatedrobots.com/embedded-programming-and-stm32f4/) 
website. Please note that this is still work in progress but you can always [subscribe](http://www.actuatedrobots.com/subscribe/) to stay up to date.

This tutorial is split into multiple sections and covers following areas:
1) tut1_cross_compilation - Cross-compilation for STM32F407xx
2) tut2_clocks - Setting up clock and using SysTick
3) tut3_debugging - Debugging with JTAG
4) tut4_communication - Sending data over UART to Linux and plotting
5) More coming...
